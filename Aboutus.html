  This is our founder Sam, Linx was founded in 2010. Sam was an enthusiastic artist who always loved creating pieces.
  There was just one problem, Sam felt that the prices people were paying for there supplies was too much for what
  they were getting. No amount of deals, discounts, nor coupons could help, when in the end your still paying a large
  amount for what your getting. Then one day Sam had an Idea of making his own Company for other people like him. But
  first the name had to come into play of course. The name Linx is an old family name that has been passed down through
  generations, Sam decided to continue the tradition, but that would be a lie if we told you that. the real reason that
  Sam deceided to name the Company Linx, is becuase of how links sounds kind of like Linx, and the way that came about
  was from Sam's fans always asking for links to where they get there supplies. So that's the real reason we came to be.<br><br>
  Since Linx is always here to help, a good thing that we at Linx like to do is think. Take our word for it, if your also an art fanatic, then these 3 tips might be useful.</p>
        <h5>1. Only get what you need.</h5>
  <p>Our founder always found themselves in this typical dilemma, where Sam always gets so much craft and art supplies when getting supplies,
  and tends to go overboard and beyond for supplies they he really needed.</P>
        <h5>2. Manage your supplies.</h5>
  <p>Using too little and too much is bad, that's why our founder thought it would be better if we only take what we need, and not be so greedy by using so much
  of paint, and not so cheap by using so little.</p>
        <h5>3.Make sure your getting it's worth</h5>
  <p>Most art stores will charge more than what the actual price is, and that doesn't sound any bit awesome in any way, that's Why you should always look
  for other options and see which is the price that you're willing to pay for, even if it's not us, our founder always encourages artists of all ages to find
  there supplies at a reasonable price.</p>
